      Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed and published by video game company
      <span style="color:blue"><i>miHoYo</i></span>.
    </h1>
    <h2 class="about" style="color:rgb(103, 14, 79);">
      It was released for Microsoft Windows, Playstation 4, iOS, and Android in 2020, and on Playstation 5 in 2021.
      The game is also set for release on Nintendo Switch.<br>
      The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching.
      The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics where players can obtain new characters and weapons.<br>
      The base game is expanded on a regular basis through patches using the games as a service model.<br>
      Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is home to seven distinct nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god.
      The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat.
      The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.<br>
      Development began in 2017 and is currently ongoing.
      The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the game's combat mechanics and open-world immersiveness, but criticized its simplistic endgame and monetization model.
      A commercial success, the game grossed more than $3 billion in its first year of release, the highest ever first-year launch revenue for any video game.
