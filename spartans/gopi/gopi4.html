                    In terms of its design, Keeway K-Light 250V looks familiar to other cruiser bikes like Harley-Davidson Fat Bob. In international markets, the bike is offered in 125cc and 200cc variants as well. This 250cc version launched in India has larger proportions, as compared to its smaller siblings. The bike has the silhouette of a classic retro motorcycle and comes with features such as round headlamp. Users will be able to choose from three colour options â€“ Matte Black, Matte Blue and Matte Grey. Other key features include sculpted fuel tank, all-LED lights, step-up split seat, engine guard, dual exhaust, pillion back rest, short tail section and rear tyre hugger. Overall, the bike has a muscular profile, which ensures a dominating street presence. It is 2230 mm long, 920 mm wide, 1090 mm tall and has a wheelbase of 1,530 mm.

                In terms of ride comfort, the plus points include the scooped-up rider seat, pulled-back handlebar and forward-set footpegs. However, the pillion section looks relatively constrained in comparison to the rider seat. It can work for city rides, but may not be comfortable for long-distance journeys.

                    Users can expect smooth performance, as the bike comes with a belt drive system. Another useful feature is 20-litre tank capacity. This will ensure fewer stops at fuel stations. K-Light has 160mm ground clearance, which is adequate for a wide variety of environments. The bike has 16-inch wheels at both ends, shod with 120/80 front and 140/70 rear tyres.
