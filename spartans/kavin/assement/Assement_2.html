                When you think of springtime Japan, a sea of cherry trees awash with perfect pink swaying blooms is the image that is definite to flood your mind. Such is the magic of cherry blossoms or Sakura as it is known. While thousands of tourists descend upon Japan to view this natural spectacle, the locals too await it eagerly for enjoying Hanami – the tradition of viewing the cherry blossom en masse – or attending blossom festivals.  If you too have been planning to witness this natural wonder first hand, now is the perfect time to plan your travel, as the cherry trees typically bloom in late March or early April.

                The Japan Weather Association recently issued estimated dates for the cherry blossom season in different parts of the country. This estimated window for cherry blossom viewing is drawn up on basis of data collected in the previous years and suggests that Sakura season is likely to set in a little early across Japan.
